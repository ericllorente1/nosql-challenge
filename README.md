## About 
Through this project we will explore the power of NoSQL databases using Mongodb in collaboration with python and the capabilities of its libraries. We will create a Mongodb database from a json file, analyze its content and change data types, to query and organize results into dataframes. We will also delve into mongo's query capacities by creating queries with fields, sort values, pipelines, and more.
